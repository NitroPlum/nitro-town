# :houses: Nitro Town
An experimental attempt at creating a multiplayer game in Go. Players will join a Town which is a server. Everyone in a Town has their Home placed in the Town where they can interact with other players. Players work together to help each other complete tasks that everyone can use to improve their own Homes.
